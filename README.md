## Introduction

Welcome to my `Libft` project! ðŸŽ‰ Libft is a personal library of C functions designed to enhance standard library functionalities. This project serves as a foundational stepping stone for future projects in the 42 School curriculum, allowing for a deeper understanding of C programming, memory management, and the implementation of algorithms.
## Features
- A collection of essential C functions including string manipulation, memory management, and more.
- Improved understanding of C standard library functionalities.
- Enhanced skills in manual memory management and error handling.
- Compliance with the 42 School standards for project submissions.
- Libft includes a variety of functions that are categorized as follows:

### 1. Memory Manipulation

- **`ft_memset`:** Sets a block of memory to a specific value.
- **`ft_bzero`:** Zeros out a block of memory.
- **`ft_memcpy`:** Copies a block of memory from one location to another.
- **`ft_memccpy`:** Copies a block of memory up to a specific character.
- **`ft_memmove`:** Moves a block of memory, handling overlaps correctly.
- **`ft_memchr`:** Locates a character in a block of memory.
- **`ft_memcmp`:** Compares two blocks of memory.

### 2. String Manipulation

- **`ft_strlen`:** Calculates the length of a string.
- **`ft_strdup`:** Duplicates a string.
- **`ft_strcpy`:** Copies a string.
- **`ft_strncpy`:** Copies a specific number of characters from a string.
- **`ft_strcat`:** Concatenates two strings.
- **`ft_strncat`:** Concatenates a specific number of characters from two strings.
- **`ft_strlcat`:** Concatenates two strings, ensuring the result is null-terminated.

### 3. Character Checks and Conversions

- **`ft_isalpha`:** Checks if a character is an alphabetic letter.
- **`ft_isdigit`:** Checks if a character is a digit.
- **`ft_isalnum`:** Checks if a character is alphanumeric.
- **`ft_isascii`:** Checks if a character is an ASCII character.
- **`ft_isprint`:** Checks if a character is printable.
- **`ft_toupper`:** Converts a character to uppercase.
- **`ft_tolower`:** Converts a character to lowercase.

### 4. Additional Utility Functions

- **`ft_atoi`:** Converts a string to an integer.
- **`ft_itoa`:** Converts an integer to a string.
- **`ft_strchr`:** Locates a character in a string.
- **`ft_strrchr`:** Locates the last occurrence of a character in a string.
- **`ft_strstr`:** Finds the first occurrence of a substring.
- **`ft_strnstr`:** Finds the first occurrence of a substring within a specific number of characters.
- **`ft_strcmp`:** Compares two strings.
- **`ft_strncmp`:** Compares a specific number of characters from two strings.
